            file (str or file like): An xlsx/tsv file to open or a File object.
            file_type (str or None): ".xlsx" for excel, ".tsv" or ".txt" for tsv. data. If file is a string, the
            worksheet_name (str or None): The name of the Excel workbook worksheet that contains the HED tags.
                Not applicable to tsv files. If omitted for Excel, the first worksheet is assumed.
            tag_columns (list): A list of ints containing the columns that contain the HED tags.
                The default value is [2] indicating only the second column has tags.
            has_column_names (bool): True if file has column names. Validation will skip over the
                first line of the file if the spreadsheet as column names.
            column_prefix_dictionary (dict): A dictionary with column number keys and prefix values.
            def_dicts (DefinitionDict or list):  A DefinitionDict or list of DefDicts containing definitions for this
                object other than the ones extracted from the SpreadsheetInput object itself.

        Examples:
            A prefix dictionary {3: 'Label/', 5: 'Description/'} indicates that column 3 and 5 have HED tags
            that need to be prefixed by Label/ and Description/ respectively.
