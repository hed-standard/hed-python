# Lychee link checker configuration
# This file configures how lychee validates links in the repository
#
# For more information about lychee configuration, see:
# https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee#configuration

# This configuration addresses false positive errors from the link checker:
# - 403 Forbidden: Some sites (npmjs.com, mathworks.com, doi.org) block automated 
#   requests but work fine in browsers
# - 429 Too Many Requests: Rate limiting doesn't mean the link is broken
# - See .lycheeignore for sites/patterns that are completely excluded

# Accept these HTTP status codes as valid
# 200: OK (standard success)
# 204: No Content (valid response with no body)
# 206: Partial Content (valid for range requests)
# 403: Forbidden (some sites block automated requests but links work in browsers)
# 429: Too Many Requests (rate limiting, link may be valid)

# Timeout for requests (in seconds)
