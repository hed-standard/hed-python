'''Schema attributes''' <nowiki>[Allowed node, unit class or unit modifier attributes.]</nowiki>
* allowedCharacter <nowiki>{valueClassProperty}[A schema attribute of value classes specifying a special character that is allowed in expressing the value of a placeholder. Normally the allowed characters are listed individually. However, the word letters designates the upper and lower case alphabetic characters and the word digits designates the digits 0-9. The word blank designates the blank character.]</nowiki>
* defaultUnits <nowiki>{unitClassProperty}[A schema attribute of unit classes specifying the default units to use if the placeholder has a unit class but the substituted value has no units.]</nowiki> 
* extensionAllowed <nowiki>{boolProperty}[A schema attribute indicating that users can add unlimited levels of child nodes under this tag. This tag is propagated to child nodes with the exception of the hashtag placeholders.]</nowiki>
* recommended  <nowiki>{boolProperty}[A schema attribute indicating that the event-level HED string should include this tag.]</nowiki> 
* relatedTag <nowiki>[A schema attribute suggesting HED tags that are closely related to this tag. This attribute is used by tagging tools.]</nowiki> 
* requireChild  <nowiki>{boolProperty}[A schema attribute indicating that one of the node elements descendants must be included when using this tag.]</nowiki> 
* required <nowiki>{boolProperty}[A schema attribute indicating that every event-level HED string should include this tag.]</nowiki>
* SIUnit  <nowiki>{boolProperty, unitProperty}[A schema attribute indicating that this unit element is an SI unit and can be modified by multiple and submultiple names. Note that some units such as byte are designated as SI units although they are not part of the standard.]</nowiki>
* SIUnitModifier <nowiki>{boolProperty, unitModifierProperty}[A schema attribute indicating that this SI unit modifier represents a multiple or submultiple of a base unit rather than a unit symbol.]</nowiki> 
* SIUnitSymbolModifier <nowiki>{boolProperty, unitModifierProperty}[A schema attribute indicating that this SI unit modifier represents a multiple or submultiple of a unit symbol rather than a base symbol.]</nowiki>
* suggestedTag <nowiki>[A schema attribute that indicates another tag  that is often associated with this tag. This attribute is used by tagging tools to provide tagging suggestions.]</nowiki>
* tagGroup <nowiki>{boolProperty}[A schema attribute indicating the tag can only appear inside a tag group.] </nowiki> 
* takesValue <nowiki>{boolProperty}[A schema attribute indicating the tag is a hashtag placeholder that is expected to be replaced with a user-defined value.] </nowiki> 
* topLevelTagGroup <nowiki>{boolProperty}[A schema attribute indicating that this tag (or its descendants) can only appear in a top-level tag group.] </nowiki> 
* unique <nowiki>{boolProperty}[A schema attribute indicating that only one of this tag or its descendants can be used  in the event-level HED string.]</nowiki> 
* unitClass <nowiki>[A schema attribute specifying which unit class this value tag belongs to.]</nowiki> 
* unitPrefix <nowiki>{boolProperty, unitProperty}[A schema attribute applied specifically to unit elements to designate that the unit indicator is a prefix (e.g., dollar sign in the currency units).]</nowiki> 
* unitSymbol <nowiki>{boolProperty, unitProperty}[A schema attribute indicating this tag is an abbreviation or symbol representing a type of unit. Unit symbols represent both the singular and the plural and thus cannot be pluralized.]</nowiki>
* valueClass <nowiki>[A schema attribute specifying which value class this value tag belongs to.]</nowiki> 

'''Properties''' <nowiki>[Properties of the schema attributes themselves. These are used for schema handling and verification.]</nowiki>
* boolProperty <nowiki>[Indicates that the schema attribute represents something that is either true or false and does not have a value. Attributes without this value are assumed to have string values.]</nowiki>
* unitClassProperty <nowiki>[Indicates that the schema attribute is meant to be applied to unit classes.]</nowiki>
* unitModifierProperty <nowiki>[Indicates that the schema attribute is meant to be applied to unit modifier classes.]</nowiki>
* unitProperty <nowiki>[Indicates that the schema attribute is meant to be applied to units within a unit class.]</nowiki> 
* valueClassProperty <nowiki>[Indicates that the schema attribute is meant to be applied to value classes.]</nowiki>

'''Epilogue'''
This is an updated version of the schema format. The properties are now part of the schema. The schema attributes are designed to be checked in software rather than hard-coded. The schema attributes, themselves have properties.
