HED_0012499	Eye-blink-artifact	5	Eye-artifact		Artifact from eye blinking. In EEG, Fp1/Fp2 electrodes become electro-positive with eye closure because the cornea is positively charged causing a negative deflection in Fp1/Fp2. If the eye blink is unilateral, consider prosthetic eye.

HED_0012510	Sweat-artifact	4	Biological-artifact		Artifact from sweating. In EEG, this is a low amplitude undulating waveform that is usually greater than 2 seconds and may appear to be an unstable baseline.	
HED_0012511	Tongue-movement-artifact	4	Biological-artifact		Artifact from tongue movement (Glossokinetic). The tongue functions as a dipole, with the tip negative with respect to the base. In EEG, the artifact produced by the tongue has a broad potential field that drops from frontal to occipital areas, although it is less steep than that produced by eye movement artifacts. The amplitude of the potentials is greater inferiorly than in parasagittal regions; the frequency is variable but usually in the delta range. Chewing and sucking can produce similar artifacts.	
HED_0012512	Nonbiological-artifact	3	Data-artifact		A data artifact arising from a non-biological source.
