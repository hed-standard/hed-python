* unitSymbol <nowiki>{boolProperty, unitProperty}[A schema attribute indicating this tag is an abbreviation or symbol representing a type of unit. Unit symbols represent both the singular and the plural and thus cannot be pluralized.]</nowiki>

'''Properties'''
* boolProperty <nowiki>[Indicates that the schema attribute represents something that is either true or false and does not have a value. Attributes without this value are assumed to have string values.]</nowiki>
* unitClassProperty <nowiki>[Indicates that the schema attribute is meant to be applied to unit classes.]</nowiki>
* unitModifierProperty <nowiki>[Indicates that the schema attribute is meant to be applied to unit modifier classes.]</nowiki>
* unitProperty <nowiki>[Indicates that the schema attribute is meant to be applied to units within a unit class.]</nowiki>

'''Epilogue'''
This is the new format for the mediawiki schema. The schema attributes are designed to be checked in software rather than hard-coded. The schema attributes, themselves have properties.
