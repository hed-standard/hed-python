'''Properties''' <nowiki>[Properties of the schema attributes themselves. These are used for schema handling and verification.]</nowiki>

'''Epilogue'''
This is the new format for the mediawiki schema. The schema attributes are designed to be checked in software rather than hard-coded. The schema attributes, themselves have properties. These are:

* boolProperty - indicates that that attribute represents something that is either true or false and does not have a value. Attributes without this value are assumed to have string values.
* unitClassProperty - indicates that this attribute is designed to be applied to unit classes.
* unitModifierProperty - indicates that this attribute is designed to be applied to unit classes.
* unitProperty - indicates that this a applies to units within a unit class.
