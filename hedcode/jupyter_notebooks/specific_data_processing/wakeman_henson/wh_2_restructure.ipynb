    "This script summarizes the event structures in the W-H-MEEG dataset\n",
    "for consistency and potential remapping.  The script assumes that\n",
    "a previous restructuring of the initial events in `*_events.tsv`\n",
    "has been accomplished using `wh_fix_initial_events.ipynb` has\n",
    "been dumped to `*_events_temp1.tsv`.  This scripts performs various\n",
    "transformations and dumps the result to `*_events_temp2.tsv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transformations:**\n",
    "1. Delete the `value` and the `response_time` column.\n",
    "2. Rename the `repetition_type` column as `rep_status`.\n",
    "3. Rename the `trigger` column as `value`.\n",
    "4. Insert a column called `trial` with the trial number. Trial anchors are `show_face_initial`\n",
    "and `show_cross`.  The excluded tags are `setup_left_sym` and `setup_right_sym`.\n",
    "5. The value column should be 1 when `event_type is `show_cross`.\n",
    "6. The `event_type` column should be `double_press` when the value column is 4352.\n",
    "7. Insert new column `rep_lag` and calculate based on the `rep_status` column values and the `stim_file` values.\n",
    "8. Reorder the columns as `onset`, `duration`, `sample`, `event_type`, `face_type`,\n",
    "`rep_status`, `rep_lag`, `value`, and `stim_file`.\n",
    "9. Save as `*_events_temp2.tsv`."
