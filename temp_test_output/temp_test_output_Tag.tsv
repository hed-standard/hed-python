	1	Posterior-dominant-rhythm	Background-activity	suggestedTag=Finding-significance-to-recording, suggestedTag=Finding-frequency, suggestedTag=Finding-amplitude-asymmetry, suggestedTag=Posterior-dominant-rhythm-property, inLibrary=score	Rhythmic activity occurring during wakefulness over the posterior regions of the head, generally with maximum amplitudes over the occipital areas. Amplitude varies. Best seen with eyes closed and during physical relaxation and relative mental inactivity. Blocked or attenuated by attention, especially visual, and mental effort. In adults this is the alpha rhythm, and the frequency is 8 to 13 Hz. However the frequency can be higher or lower than this range (often a supra or sub harmonic of alpha frequency) and is called alpha variant rhythm (fast and slow alpha variant rhythm). In children, the normal range of the frequency of the posterior dominant rhythm is age-dependant.

	2	Eye-blink-artifact	Biological-artifact	suggestedTag=Brain-laterality, suggestedTag=Brain-region, suggestedTag=Sensors, suggestedTag=Multifocal-finding, suggestedTag=Artifact-significance-to-recording, inLibrary=score	Example for EEG: Fp1/Fp2 become electropositive with eye closure because the cornea is positively charged causing a negative deflection in Fp1/Fp2. If the eye blink is unilateral, consider prosthetic eye. If it is in F8 rather than Fp2 then the electrodes are plugged in wrong.
	2	Eye-movement-horizontal-artifact	Biological-artifact	suggestedTag=Brain-laterality, suggestedTag=Brain-region, suggestedTag=Sensors, suggestedTag=Multifocal-finding, suggestedTag=Artifact-significance-to-recording, inLibrary=score	Example for EEG: There is an upward deflection in the Fp2-F8 derivation, when the eyes move to the right side. In this case F8 becomes more positive and therefore. When the eyes move to the left, F7 becomes more positive and there is an upward deflection in the Fp1-F7 derivation.
	2	Eye-movement-vertical-artifact	Biological-artifact	suggestedTag=Brain-laterality, suggestedTag=Brain-region, suggestedTag=Sensors, suggestedTag=Multifocal-finding, suggestedTag=Artifact-significance-to-recording, inLibrary=score	Example for EEG: The EEG shows positive potentials (50-100 micro V) with bi-frontal distribution, maximum at Fp1 and Fp2, when the eyeball rotated upward. The downward rotation of the eyeball was associated with the negative deflection. The time course of the deflections was similar to the time course of the eyeball movement.

The artifact produced by the tongue has a broad potential field that drops from frontal to occipital areas, although it is less steep than that produced by eye movement artifacts. The amplitude of the potentials is greater inferiorly than in parasagittal regions; the frequency is variable but usually in the delta range. Chewing and sucking can produce similar artifacts.

If the causing movement is repetitive, the artifact might resemble a rhythmic EEG activity.
	2	Respiration-artifact	Biological-artifact	suggestedTag=Brain-laterality, suggestedTag=Brain-region, suggestedTag=Sensors, suggestedTag=Multifocal-finding, suggestedTag=Artifact-significance-to-recording, inLibrary=score	Respiration can produce 2 kinds of artifacts. One type is in the form of slow and rhythmic activity, synchronous with the body movements of respiration and mechanically affecting the impedance of (usually) one electrode. The other type can be slow or sharp waves that occur synchronously with inhalation or exhalation and involve those electrodes on which the patient is lying.
	2	Pulse-artifact	Biological-artifact	suggestedTag=Brain-laterality, suggestedTag=Brain-region, suggestedTag=Sensors, suggestedTag=Multifocal-finding, suggestedTag=Artifact-significance-to-recording, inLibrary=score	Example for EEG: Occurs when an EEG electrode is placed over a pulsating vessel. The pulsation can cause slow waves that may simulate EEG activity. A direct relationship exists between ECG and the pulse waves (200-300 millisecond delay after ECG equals QRS complex).
	2	ECG-artifact	Biological-artifact	suggestedTag=Brain-laterality, suggestedTag=Brain-region, suggestedTag=Sensors, suggestedTag=Multifocal-finding, suggestedTag=Artifact-significance-to-recording, inLibrary=score	Example for EEG: Far-field potential generated in the heart. The voltage and apparent surface of the artifact vary from derivation to derivation and, consequently, from montage to montage. The artifact is observed best in referential montages using earlobe electrodes A1 and A2. ECG artifact is recognized easily by its rhythmicity/regularity and coincidence with the ECG tracing.
	2	Sweat-artifact	Biological-artifact	suggestedTag=Brain-laterality, suggestedTag=Brain-region, suggestedTag=Sensors, suggestedTag=Multifocal-finding, suggestedTag=Artifact-significance-to-recording, inLibrary=score	Is a low amplitude undulating waveform that is usually greater than 2 seconds and may appear to be an unstable baseline.
	2	EMG-artifact	Biological-artifact	suggestedTag=Brain-laterality, suggestedTag=Brain-region, suggestedTag=Sensors, suggestedTag=Multifocal-finding, suggestedTag=Artifact-significance-to-recording, inLibrary=score	Myogenic potentials are the most common artifacts. Frontalis and temporalis muscles (ex..: clenching of jaw muscles) are common causes. Generally, the potentials generated in the muscles are of shorter duration than those generated in the brain. The frequency components are usually beyond 30-50 Hz, and the bursts are arrhythmic.

	3	Absence-seizure	Seizure-classification	inLibrary=score	Absence seizures present with a sudden cessation of activity and awareness. Absence seizures tend to occur in younger age groups, have more sudden start and termination, and they usually display less complex automatisms than do focal seizures with impaired awareness, but the distinctions are not absolute.

	4	Typical-absence-seizure	Absence-seizure	inLibrary=score	A sudden onset, interruption of ongoing activities, a blank stare, possibly a brief upward deviation of the eyes. Usually the patient will be unresponsive when spoken to. Duration is a few seconds to half a minute with very rapid recovery. Although not always available, an EEG would show generalized epileptiform discharges during the event. An absence seizure is by definition a seizure of generalized onset.

	4	Eyelid-myoclonia-absence-seizure	Absence-seizure	inLibrary=score	Eyelid myoclonia are myoclonic jerks of the eyelids and upward deviation of the eyes, often precipitated by closing the eyes or by light. Eyelid myoclonia can be associated with absences, but also can be motor seizures without a corresponding absence, making them difficult to categorize. The 2017 classification groups them with nonmotor (absence) seizures, which may seem counterintuitive, but the myoclonia in this instance is meant to link with absence, rather than with nonmotor.
